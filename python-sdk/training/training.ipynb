    "\n",
    "Zuva provides over 1300 built-in fields designed to cover many different use cases. However, if you need to develop your own fields, you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [AI Trainer](https://zuva.ai/ai-trainer/): Provides a no-code solution to training new fields for use in Zuva API or Analyze. Simply upload your documents, highlight your annotations, and click train. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Zuva training API: Provides low level access to Zuva's field-training functionality, suitable for integration into a custom document viewer or automated workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the process of training a new field using the API via the Zuva Python SDK.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn to:\n",
    "- Submit training documents\n",
    "- Provide example annotations\n",
    "- Create a new Zuva field\n",
    "- Train the field\n",
    "- Get Metadata about the field\n",
    "- Test the field\n",

    "- The Python interpreter (this tutorial uses v3.10)\n",
    "- A Zuva account and token - see the [Getting started guide](https://zuva.ai/documentation/quickstart/)\n",
