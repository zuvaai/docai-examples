# Spreadsheet tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to using Zuva API to capture information about a document and save it to a spreadsheet.

The tutorial is available as an [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), plain Python and plain markdown. The same
content is also available on the [Zuva documentation website](https://zuva.ai/documentation/tutorials/python-sdk/).

## Updating the content

If you would like to update the content, please work on it as a Jupyter notebook (spreadsheet.ipynb) and use `sh export-notebook.sh` to
generate the python and markdown versions.
