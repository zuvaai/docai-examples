    "This document contains a step-by-step tutorial on how to leverage DocAI to obtain key metadata from your documents, as well as how this metadata can be saved to a spreadsheet for ease-of-reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have gone through this tutorial, you will be left with a working Python script that leverages multiple packages to take documents from your local folder, use machine learning (via DocAI) to extract and classify key metadata and save the content in a spreadsheet. Best of all, you will be able to explain what each component of the script does!\n",
