    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The layouts are how DocAI “sees” the document. It contains metadata about every character and page from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover how to request the layouts for a local PDF document, as well as parse the content in that file to see how DocAI “saw” the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have gone through this tutorial, you will be left with a working Python script that leverages multiple packages to take a layouts document. This script can be used to ingest layouts content and output the relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will you learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is what you will learn by going through this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create an instance of the Python SDK to interact with DocAI\n",
    "- How to submit a document to DocAI\n",
    "- How to create an OCR request\n",
    "- How to load and iterate through the contents of a layouts file in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this tutorial, you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Python interpreter (this tutorial uses v3.10)\n",
    "- A Zuva account and token - see the [Getting started guide](https://zuva.ai/documentation/quickstart/)\n",
    "- A copy of Zuva’s [DocAI Python SDK](https://github.com/zuvaai/zdai-python)\n",
    "- A copy of [recognition_results_pb2.py](https://github.com/zuvaai/hocr-to-eocr-converter/blob/main/recognition_results_pb2.py)\n",
    "- The `google.protobuf` Python package (this tutorial uses v3.0.0), usually installed with `pip install protobuf` or `pip3 install protobuf`\n",
    "\n",
    "## OCR\n",
    "For DocAI to perform classification and extractions on the documents submitted to it, it must first be able to “see” what content exists in the document. Whether it be a digital-native PDF (e.g. Word Document saved as a PDF) or a potential third-party paper in PDF format that contains a scan of a physical document, DocAI needs a method to “read” the content so that downstream processing can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical Character Recognition enables DocAI to achieve this. By going through every character, on every page, DocAI creates a new representation of the user-provided document. This new representation allows DocAI to have a better “understanding” of the contents provided by the user, and thus is used in DocAI’s downstream processing for all of its machine learning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OCR is an optional service. However, if you would like to skip DocAI’s OCR, you will need to create your own representation using the output of your OCR engine, or provide raw text. The latter results in a partial degradation of machine learning performance due to it not containing the physical locations of where the characters exist on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layouts: The Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The layouts schema can be found [here](https://github.com/zuvaai/hocr-to-eocr-converter/blob/main/recognition_results.proto).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic overview is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a `Document`. This is the “entry-point” into the contents of the layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `Document` contains a list of `Characters`.\n",
    "  - Each `Character` is represented by its unicode value\n",
    "  - Each `Character` has a `BoundingBox`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `Document` contains a list of `Pages`\n",
    "  - Each `Page` has the `width` (in pixels)\n",
    "  - Each `Page` has the `height` (in pixels)\n",
    "  - Each `Page` has a horizontal dots-per-inch (DPI)\n",
    "  - Each `Page` has a vertical dots-per-inch (DPI)\n",
    "  - Each `Page` has a `CharacterRange` (e.g. “characters 500 to 1000 exist on this page”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks who develop applications that contain a document viewer to visualize where extractions occurred in their contracts would leverage the layouts information to map what DocAI extracted to the document/pages that the end-user (e.g. a reviewer) is shown in their solution’s document viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let’s Build!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the necessary packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to import the necessary Python packages in your script. Below are the packages needed by this tutorial:"
